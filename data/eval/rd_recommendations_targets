do you like really messed up movies?like disturbing but good?
great! i have some weird ones for you... have you seen @ pi  (1998) @ ? it is about a mathematician who loses his mind. same director as @ requiem for a dream (2000) @ and @ black swan  (2010) @
yes! very! they are very good but very disturbing.
i wou;dn't reccomend @ requiem for a dream (2000) @ to watch with your lady... it is pretty explicit and rough unless she is tough! lol
another very good one is @ antichrist  (2009) @ directed by this wacko lars von trier... it is spooky and gross but very well directed. the photography is beautiful and eerie
thanks! enjoy!
hi, i am good. have you seen @ first blood (1982) @
you would love it, that's the best rambo movie! do you like stallone?
have you at least seen @ rocky (1976) @
i've seen it several times pretty much every decade. you should watch the new @ rocky  (2006) @
30 years after the first one, i loved it. do you like movies about sports?
what genre do you like?
did you see @ ghostbusters (1984) @
i didn't like @ ghostbusters  (2016) @ either. they should have just let the franchise alone. did you watch @ slumdog millionaire (2008) @
i am glad you liked it. you will probably enjoy @ borat (2006) @ too. good social commentary, sarcastic look at life in america.
okay! how about some comedies? have you seen @ horrible bosses (2011) @ or @ horrible bosses 2 (2014) @ ?
if you are an alwys sunny in phil fan you will dig them. charlie day is in both and was one of the writers
if you like older movies and steve martin, @ the jerk (1979) @ is a classic!
as is @ the man with two brains (1983) @
check out @ the jerk (1979) @ and @ the man with two brains (1983) @ then.. both older and both classics
great! glad to have helped! have great day!
hi! what kind of movies do you like?
have you seen @ the greatest showman (2017) @ ? hugh jackman plays barnum.. about the early days of the circus and a great musical!
also, everyone should see the musical @ grease  (1978) @ at least once!
but i would avoid @ grease 2 (1982) @ at all costs!
other musicals i would reccomend are some of the classics: @ west side story  (1961) @, @ evita  (1996) @ and @ camelot  (1967) @ have not seen @ dreamgirls  (2006) @ but i keep hearing it is good!
then i am glad i suggested them! i will check it ou!
hi how are you&gt;
what genre do you like?
i am great, well that's fantastic i have some solid suggestions for you. did you see @ titanic (2012) @
one of the best documentaries. you should watch @ pearl harbor  (2001) @ very powerful movie.
you will like it. did you see @ american ninja (1985) @
it's a great classic comedy. @ beverly hills ninja (1997) @ is even better.

@ you were never really here @ looks good too, but i only saw the previews.
hi!
what sort of movies do you like, good sir or madam?
ah! let me think.... there is always the classic @ the time machine  (1960) @ if you like older flicks.
and there is the goofball time travel movie @ bill & ted's excellent adventure (1989) @ lol
but if you want a very serious time travel movie ful of science and brain twists, you could try @ primer  (2004) @ it is almost too serious but it is really good
i think one of my favorites is good old @ back to the future (1985) @
there are a lot of good time travel movies out there haha! me too!!! good tlaking to you! hope you have some good suggestions
hello! what kind of movies are you looking for today?
i'm not super familiar with scary movies. i have a friend who loves them and prefers the classics like @ a nightmare on elm street (1984) @ and @ bride of chucky (1998) @
i havent seen taken but i did enjoy @ inception (2010) @ which is a thriller in sort of a different vein
thrillers like @ inception (2010) @ i would also suggest @ gravity  (2013) @ as well.
or @ interstellar  (2014) @ as well!
have a good day!
hi there, what kind of movies are you looking to see?
yes, have you seen @ food, inc. (2008) @ ? that one was a real eye opener to the food and farming industry
i loved super size me, and it's a little like that but with more focus on farming and the evil monsanto company.
have you seen @ making a murderer @ on netflix? that was a crazy series
so good. i love a good documentary, how about a political one? @ fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) @ was very intense.

well i hope you enjoy! :)
gotcha! well check those two out and have a great day!
hi, i haven't seen a new movie in a while but was thinking of revisiting a classic like @ romeo & juliet  (2013) @ do you like romance films?
i have never heard of it! i think my favorite film is @ the revenant  (2015) @ i am a huge leonardo dicaprio fan! have you seen it?
@ ace ventura: pet detective (1994) @ is a good one i remember from my childhood.
@ liar liar (1997) @ was my next pick
i did but it did really feel like a jim carrey role.
did you enjoy @ yes man  (2008) @ ? yeah @ the number 23 (2007) @ was a very weird one
he basically takes a vow to say yes to everything no matter what for a year
i prefer his early films
yes i did. i cant believe they made a sequel @ dumb and dumber to (2014) @
first 1 was better. 2 had its moments.
how about @ bruce almighty (2003) @ did you see that one?
i totally agree. i love @ the mask  (1994) @

@ avengers: infinity war (2018) @ was amazing, most recent movie iive seen and tons of action from start to end
hello how are you
what kinds of movies do you enjoy
i'm not too familiar with musicals, my experience only goes as far as @ high school musical  @ @ high school musical 2 @ and @ high school musical 3: senior year (2008) @
@ dream house  (2011) @ was a really good thriller
hello how are you
what kinds of movies do you enjoy
@ alien  (1979) @ @ the thing  (1982) @ and @ the terminator (1984) @ are all classics
cant go wrong with @ godfather  (1991) @
hello! how are you?
i'm doing great, thanks!
if you like silly movies, there is @ dumb and dumber (1994) @
of course, if you want something edgy, i really liked @ clerks (1994) @
i always loved @ sleepless in seattle (1993) @. i remember seeing that when it came out. oh, another great comedy is @ pretty woman (1990) @ but it's not purely comedy, i suppose.
hello how are you
im not familiar with that movie, but i think youd enjoy @ gone girl  (2014) @ @ shutter island  (2010) @ and @ the sixth sense (1999) @
@ girls trip (2017) @ was hilarious
hello how are you
what kinds of movies do you enjoy
@ the matrix (1999) @ @ alien vs. predator  (2004) @ and @ avengers: infinity war (2018) @ were all great
it wasnt bad at al, decent action
hello how are you
what kinds fo movies are you into
@ the human centipede 2  (2011) @ and @ the human centipede 3  (2015) @ were just as good as the first and @ the strange thing about the johnsons @ is equally as disturbing
no, im not into movies like that
@ avengers: infinity war (2018) @ was great last movie i saw, plan to see @ deadpool 2  (2018) @ next
hello how are you
@ blade runner 2049 (2017) @ @ watchmen  (2009) @ @ ghost in the shell  (2017) @ were all great
it was actually really good unerrated movie
did you like them
hi there
what have you seen lately? i'm great
i'd like to recommend you some
excellent, have you seen @ blade  (1998) @ or @ watchmen  (2009) @ ? i haven't seen @ watchmen  (2009) @ but someone told me it was awesome @ ant-man  (2015) @ was wonderful as well
hello! how are you?
sure, i love horror films. i think one that is often overlooked is @ phantasm  (1979) @. some of the dialogue is stiff, but it has a unique concept and great scares.
if you like something that is creepy, there is @ the omen (1976) @. i think the original one is the best!
if you are in the mood for something that is more playful, theres always @ creepshow (1982) @. it's a collection of stories so im sure there would be something in there you would enjoy.
thank you! it sounds like you have good taste, too. finally, i would suggest @ the exorcist  (1973) @. always my go-to when i want to be truly frightened. i remember seeing the re-release several years back, being the only person in the movie theater because it was in the middle of the week when i was off, and jumping out of my skin several times because it was so freaky.

yes, exactly and they all are a twist on real human adventures most are bad science experiments gone wrong.
i like both movies that you mentioned @ thor  @
haha well luckily if you watch each movie they do really stand alone.
@ the avengers  (2012) @ are all apart of the same world with individual problems with their gifts that is a good point of view you make. i did not think to mention the different brands of comics
@ guardians of the galaxy  (2014) @ is more like @ star wars  (1977) @
the stories of the universe verses galaxy and worlds. i love them all. they are very entertaining
yes you do the same. try one of the newer stories like @ deadpool 2  (2018) @ you may not be able to tie it into other comic stories. however, you will surely be entertained. you too.
well you are gonna love part 2, hands down! it is action packed and full of humor.

hi
im fine, ty for asking. what are you favorite movies?
good choices
i would recommend @ dumb and dumber (1994) @ i love those movies as well!
i may also recommend @ superbad  (2007) @ your welcome and goodbye!
hi, i'm great. thanks for asking. how are you? what kind of movies do you like?
oh sure. how about @ deadpool 2  (2018) @ i just seen it and loved it. you'd want to also catch @ deadpool  (2016) @ before seeing part two. both movies are hilarious and his love interest makes it a little romantic.
i love all the same genres too.
im sure it could fall under the comedy category. and its actually a movie based on a comic book series. he's part of marvel universe and its packed with comedy.
hes more of an anti-super hero actually so he doesnt always do things the right way.
how about @ game night (2018) @ for a good old comedy my favorite all time, would be @ goodfellas (1990) @ yours?
awesome! im sure you'll enjoy @ deadpool  (2016) @ hes played by ryan reynolds.
heh, i've never seen @ notebook  (2006) @ but goodfellas is a classic with ray liota! check that out too. robert dinero is in it too.
enjoy and have a great day haha, you can thank me now. ;) enjoy your viewing.
have a great day! goodbye now.
hi! how are you? what kind of movies do you like?
those are super funny! have you seen @ there's something about mary (1998) @ ?
hi. i am good, thanks for asking. how about you?
any plans for today? should i recommend you something?
sorry i am not familiar with @ training day (2001) @ or @ lethal weapon (1987) @. what genres those movies are? thriller?
well as for crime i would obviously recommend you the classic of all times @ the godfather (1972) @. but i am pretty sure you've seen it
how about @ shutter island  (2010) @ ?
i've never seen @ scarface  (1983) @ but @ shutter island  (2010) @ is really amazing with leonardo di caprio you should totally watch it !
hello, how are you? hope you're having a great day.
oh yes, so many... let me think one sec. ;) one of my favorites is @ overboard  (1987) @ its a classic and the main characters were actually married in real life so it was fun to see them acting together.
@ notting hill  @, @ pretty woman (1990) @ and @ how to lose a guy in 10 days (2003) @ are great too! i also love all of the @ bridget jones  @ movies have you seen any? oh, how could i forget @ theres something about mary (1998) @ that is another classic. sorry im rambling! lol
oh, you should check them out. there's also classics.
you're welcome!

and @ shaun of the dead (2004) @ is my favorite horror comedy! super funny and gory.
i'm good! and you?
yes! @ insidious  (2011) @ is a good horror and @ super troopers (2001) @ is one of my favorite comedies- have you seen either of those? @ annabelle  (2014) @ is so creepy! and @ superbad  (2007) @ is super funny!
i've not seen @ girls trip (2017) @
hello! what kind of movies are you into?
oh, yes...love both of those. how about something like @ porky's (1981) @ my husband and i re-watched @ police academy  (1984) @ recently. it really is a hoot and makes for a fun nostalgic trip.
of course, @ sixteen candles (1984) @ is silly and campy. love molly ringwald.
hello! what kind of movies are you into? i'm good, i hope you are well, too.
sure! if you are into action, i'd recommend seeing @ beverly hills cop (1984) @.
if you want more action than that, you could see @ avengers: infinity war (2018) @ i haven't seen @ inception (2010) @. i keep meaning to see it.
i liked @ avengers grimm (2015) @. also, @ the dark knight  (2008) @ is great for edge-of-your-seat action. i meant to say i liked @ avengers: infinity war (2018) @
oh, and comedy and action should get you to see @ deadpool 2  (2018) @
i haven't caught @ black panther (2018) @ yet, but plan to very soon at home. @ deadpool  (2016) @ is not for the kids, but it is funny.

@ gremlins (1984) @ is a good campy movie from that period. it is silly but fun.

if you like gangster films but want to see something that is lighter, you could see @ the freshman  (1990) @. it has marlon brando and matthew broderick. great film.
it's funny, and marlon brando is playing a &quot;real life&quot; gangster that looks like marlon brando (if that makes sense.)

i will have to check that one out.
as for a comedy have you ever seen @ uncle buck @ ? hilarious movie.

youll enjoy it very emotional movie
@ the iron giant (1999) @ was also sad at the end
i have not seen it ill check it out hop[e you enjoyed the suggestions have a great day
hello how are you?
thats a good movie. you might want to check out @ easy a (2010) @. its a very good movie.
there is another one that comes to mind that is worth watching @ thirteen  (2003) @
it seems to be a realistic portrayal of how rough growing up can sometimes be.
no i have never seen that one.
i am going to have to look that one up.
hello!
i'm not bad
i love movies like @ guardians of the galaxy  (2014) @ and @ the avengers  (2012) @ have you seen those?
i havent seen that one yet but ive heard it is really good!
i haven't seen that one. i need to.
have you seen @ hot fuzz (2007) @ it is hilarious!
i have seen that one! pretty funny.
it is! you should totally watch it tonight!
you too! enjoy the movie!
bye
hello! what kind of movie are you looking for tonight?
sure, i love horror although i'm a fan of the older movies really.
i love @ scream  (1996) @. it was well-written and even the sequels are decent.
one of the scariest movies without gore ive seen would be @ the others  (2001) @. but, if you've seen it before, it would probably be ruined for a 2nd viewing. the twist makes that movie and once you know it, it can't be unknown. i like the @ annabelle  (2014) @ movie. i havent seen the 2nd one yet.
yes, exactly! but, watch it if you haven't seen it. i hope this helps you?
hello! how are you?
i'm doing well, thanks! what kind of movies are you into?
sure! i really loved @ guardians of the galaxy  (2014) @, and the sequel, @ guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 (2017) @
@ the dark knight  (2008) @ never disappoints either.
my favorite superhero movie of all time is @ superman  (1978) @. so sad that margot kidder died recently.
i've been wanting to watch it again after i heard of her death. i think i liked @ superman ii (1980) @ even better, though.
finally, i would suggest @ spider-man: homecoming (2017) @. its the last thing i saw in a movie theater of late and its so good. i hope i have helped you out.
hello! how are you? i'm doing well. what kind of movie are you looking for?
no, i dont think ive seen that one.
if you like that type of movie, you might like @ i love you to death (1990) @.
actually, @ i love you to death (1990) @ is a comedy based on a true crime case. kinda crazy.
how about @ bridget joness diary  (2001) @ ? thats a funny comedy with a warped kind of love interest. i have to look up @ true romance (1993) @. it sounds interesting.
cool. i will look at that. @ wristcutters: a love story (2006) @ is a crazy kind of love story as well. i hope i have helped you out?
hello, how are you?
have you ever watched @ dr. strangelove (1964) @ ? for sure a classic.
or one that i always thought was a great movie @ american psycho  (2000) @.
for sure it is a really good movie gets in your head. i will always suggest @ fear and loathing in las vegas  (1998) @. i've seen the movie and read the book, for sure a great one.
hello, how are you?
there is a movie called @ the change-up (2011) @ where two guys somehow switch bodies
or @ the hot chick (2002) @, sort of a funny version of how body swapping can go horribly wrong.
i thought that it was hilarious.
otherwise too @ white chicks (2004) @ might be something along those lines as well. oh that is a good movie too.
well i hope i helped some.
hello! can i help you find a movie?
what is your favorite kind of movie? or, what are you in the mood for?
yes, i love horror movies. i enjoy the old ones. how about something like @ halloween  (1978) @ ? always a crowd-pleaser.
i never get tired of the old movies like @ phantasm  (1979) @. the dialogue is a bit stiff, but the concept and scares are great. freddy krueger is the man of horror for sure!
do you like old ones like @ rosemary's baby  (1968) @ ?
oh, and one that i remember scaring me when i was young was @ its alive  (1974) @. i wonder if it would scare me now? i remember it was gory. definitely see @ rosemarys baby  (1968) @. it has held up well.
i hope you have something here you can use?
cool. i hope you have fun watching something!
good bye.
hello! what are some of your favorite films?
great film have you see @ the conjuring (2013) @ or @ insidious  (2011) @ ? or even @ the others  (2001) @

i love @ psycho  (1960) @. if you like that movie, you'd love @ rear window (1954) @ or @ the birds  (1963) @.
hitchcock was a master at scaring the pants off folks, of course.
these birds just seem to randomly start attacking people. i think there was some reason for it, but i don't remember that much. i just remember it was scary. you would probably like something from stephen king. i would recommend @ the shining  (1980) @.

ah, i see. you might enjoy @ the circle  (2015) @ ; its on netflix and is definitely more of a psychological type. its sort of like @ cube  (1997) @, which is older but kind of along the same lines where people are trapped and have to find a way out, usually at the demise of others. thank you! :-)

hey
@ the shawshank redemption (1994) @ or maybe @ the rock  (1996) @. nicholas cage is in that, so it's kind of campy sometimes.
and @ the green mile  (1999) @ makes me cry everytime nicholas cage was in @ con air (1997) @ too. but i wouldn't call it campy
hi
have you seen @ the lord of the rings  @

i recommend @ l.a. confidential  (1997) @ or @ the girl with the dragon tattoo  (2011) @

well, that is not the movie i was suggesting
game night 2018
it was great, check out @ baywatch  (2017) @
i want to see @ the lego batman movie (2017) @

hey there. can i recommend something to watch?
hmmmm. i don't suppose you like @ twilight  (2008) @ ?

i'm doing well, thanks! i hope you are, too.
oh, that's a great category.
i could suggest @ sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street  (2007) @ with johnny depp. it's a musical, but it has lots of gore.
you could also see @ get out (2017) @
oh, yes, the clown movie was great. haha!
i did see that one. i had to remind myself. you would like @ mama  (2013) @. it is very scary and has a monster that stalks some kids, if i remember correctly.
isnt that the one where the monster is looking after some girls? its been awhile.
you, too! take care and good bye!

have you seen @ borat (2006) @
dang that movie is so funny. one of the funniest movies ever made.
yes. well i have seen about 45 minutes of it before i decided to turn it off because i did not find it funny. we have different type of humor i guess.
ah. it depends, i just don't like jack black so him being in the movie is not a good thing
yea. he is pretty good in it from what i remember. tom cruise was the best part i will probably finish that movie someday.
no i have not actaully. i have seen all the @ mission: impossible  (1996) @ movie series really excited for the next one coming out in a month
yea the 4th and the 5th one are so good. one of my most favorite action movies i have ever seen in a theater. have you seen @ a quiet place (2018) @ by any chance?

hello. since you are in this chat. if you dont mind me asking, what is your favorite movie of 2017?
yea this year is not completed yet so i did not want to ask for this year. that's fine. it is hard to remember i did like infinity war, it is probably my favorite of this year along with @ a quiet place (2018) @ have you seen it yet?
yea. it is really good, you should check it out while it still in theater. it wont be the same in your house.
have you seen @ deadpool 2  (2018) @ by any chance this year?
yea. i loved it too although i personally thought the first one was better.
yea not at all. i personally liked the first one better but the second was really good.
thats fine. i can ask you about a movie. i see a lot in my free time. yes, i loved that movie.
it is probably my favorite movie by pixar of this decade excluding inside out.
hello ! what is your favorite movie of 2018 so far?
yes, i have seen that movie. it is good. have you by any chance seen @ zodiac  (2007) @ ?
it is about a serial killer and it has robert downey jr and it is directed by david fincher you will love it
i dont really know much off the top of my head about fantasy serial killers. but have you seen @ the cabin in the woods @ its a horror movie about a killer and they have to find out who is the killer
yea that movie zodiac is based on the zodiac killer
dang i have not seen many classics. but i do think you should check out @ saw  (2004) @

ah! okay.. let's see....
there are the classics, like @ the shining  (1980) @ and @ the sixth sense (1999) @
@ the shining  (1980) @ is the early 80s... which i guess is the past now... jeez, i feel old lol i have not seen @ the others  (2001) @
its not a ghost story, but it is a good horror flick set in the past... @ mary reilly  (1996) @ is about dr. jekyls maid.
it is! very different. it has julia roberts and john malkovich.
i like costume dramas as well, and @ mary reilly  (1996) @ has a ton of costumes. corsets and brocade everywhere @ bram stoker's dracula (1992) @ is very well done. set in the victorian era, very well directed and photographed.
@ mary shelley's frankenstein  (1994) @ is cheesy but fun, and it is heavy on the costumes and scenery.
gary oldman has some pretty fabulous looks going on in that one for sure.
hi! what is your favourite movie?
me too! have you seen @ dunkirk  (2017) @ ? i haven't seen the original yet though.
ive not seen that one. ill check it out. i can recommend some old school movies too... have you seen @ ice cold in alex (1958) @ ? or @ escape to victory (1981) @ ?

i love a good drama. have you seen @ the shack  (2017) @ or @ the shape of water  (2017) @ ?
i actually havent seen it either if i'm being completely honest but it does have really good reviews. seems to have many religious undertones. so im guessing you would need to be into that.
how about @ split (2017) @ ?

hi there! what kind of movies do you like?
like @ cocoon  (1985) @ ? hmmm. have you seen @ contact  (1997) @ ? its sci-fi, but its not too dark

@ the abyss (1989) @ was great!
have you seen @ looper  (2012) @ ? it's crazy
i'm trying to think of a good comparison. it has time travel but it also has hit men. and it has a ton of action

good. tell me three of your favorite movies
have you seen @ deadpool  (2016) @ or @ never let me go  (2010) @
i really liked @ never let me go  (2010) @ it's kinda of sci-fi flick. i also really liked @ the shape of water  (2017) @
how about your favorite comedy?
seen @ the other woman  (2014) @ or @ lars and the real girl (2007) @

you have good taste.
its animated. i think youll like it

im torn between going to see @ oceans 8 (2018) @ and staying in to watch @ kubo and the two strings (2016) @
good. tell me your three favorite movies so i can make good recommendations
have you seen @ the abyss (1989) @ @ the shining  (1980) @ and @ meet the fockers (2004) @ ?

it was!!! i also really like @ the other woman  (2014) @ had me rolling on the floor
another fan!!! yes! time to go watch a movie! nice chatting with you!
heloo how are you?
i haven't seen that one but i love @ red eye  (2005) @
one of my favorites is @ the silence of the lambs  (1991) @ i love anthony hopkins
my favorite genre is horror, do you have any suggestions for me?
i saw that, i thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film, especially for a first time director
yes, representation is important have you seen any good comedies lately?
@ deadpool 2  (2018) @ was hilarious, i would definitely recommend it
one of my favorites overall is @ the jerk (1979) @. i also really enjoy mel brooks movies like @ young frankenstein (1974) @
they are definitely worth your time
hello!
doing fine, and you?
i tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with. i lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness. a good example would be the bleakness of @ waltz with bashir (2008) @ an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. what do you tend to like in films?
have you seen any of the three flavours cornetto trilogy (@ shaun of the dead (2004) @ @ hot fuzz (2007) @ @ the worlds end  (2013) @)? they're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind @ baby driver  (2017) @. they're quite british, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline youd almost forget)
any other films you like in particular?
in that case, i can just recommend the aforementioned @ baby driver  (2017) @ a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music.
i'm not sure, but i can check not at this point, unfortunately
to top things off (and fulfill my requirements), theres an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of @ inception (2010) @ @ paprika  (2006) @ by satoshi kon. it's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip. unfortunately, i'm running low on time, so ill have to stop there. i hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable. have a good evening.
hello!
me too! i am a big fan of @ die hard (1988) @
it's a classic
that is also a solid choice! the best of the terminator films
do you watch any international action films?
have you seen @ the man from nowhere  (2010) @ i love both of those!!
it used to be on netflix
@ train to busan (2016) @ is also excellent no i'll look into that for sure
the ending really got me
yeah i was just waiting for him to die, he lived longer than i thought he would
@ seven  (1995) @ is one of my favorites
oh i did watch the original, not the american remake i have really enjoyed this conversation, i'm glad we got matched up
hello
what kind of movies do you like?
well i dont really watch a lot of comedy movies but something that comes to me is @ game night (2018) @ or @ paul  (2011) @ those are some great ones
have u seen @ superbad  (2007) @ or @ wedding crashers (2005) @
hello! what kind of movie are you in the mood for? if you arent sure, i can make general suggestion. for example, i would recommend seeing @ oceans 8 (2018) @. it is a very smart movie with great actresses.
thats okay. im good, how about you?
are you in the mood for something particular?
both of those are great! i would recommend going to see @ solo  (2008) @. my friend told me it was worth the price of a ticket. and, if you like @ jumanji (1995) @, did you ever see the most recent @ jumanji  (2017) @ ? it was funny. definitely a different concept.
me, too!
great!
i hope you have fun watching some movies!
good morning!
are you looking for a movie to watch today?
cool. what kind of movie would you like to see?
that is an oldie but goody!
i was actually about to say @ better off dead  (1985) @. haha.
you would probably like @ risky business (1983) @. tom cruise doing bob segar in his underwear. doesn't get much better than that.
and, you would like @ grosse pointe blank (1997) @, of course. it has john cusak.
i mean, john cusack.
yes. it might not be an 80s movie, but it's good. youre welcome! have fun watching some movies!

thank you ! you too bye
good morning!
what kind of movies are you into?
oh, i never saw that, but i love horror and have some suggestions! there is one that i saw on netflix one weekend that i dont think people realize is really good with a cool concept. @ come back to me  (2014) @ a murderer who can bring his victims back to life. you'd just have to see it. its cool. also, one of my all-time favorite horror movies is @ the cabin in the woods @. that has a sci-fi feel, too.
i haven't seen that one but keep meaning to see it. you have good taste in movies obviously!
i hope i've been helpful to you?
hi! what kind of movies do you like?
have you seen @ the ring  (2002) @
how about @ the blair witch project (1999) @
it's good. the camera work can make people nauseous, though.
and, of course, there are classics like @ the exorcist  (1973) @ have you seen that? and @ poltergeist  (1982) @
try @ scary movie (2000) @ ! ha
have a great day!
hi, how are you today?
i'm good. what kind of movies are you looking for?
do you like older disney films like @ the shaggy dog  (1959) @ or @ escape to witch mountain  (1975) @
or for something newer, you might like @ a wrinkle in time  @
yeah, i loved that book when i was a kid! i hope they make movies of the sequels.
another newer family film is @ isle of dogs (2018) @ have you seen that yet?
hope this helps you find what you're looking for.
hello. how are you today?
great! what kind of movies do you like?
a great one is @ the princess bride  (1987) @ have you seen that? also, @ high school musical  @ is good too.
have you seen @ diary of a wimpy kid  (2010) @ or @ the karate kid  (2010) @ those are both great!
another good idea is @ beauty and the beast  (2017) @ this is the live action, not a cartoon so they might like it.
hi there how are you?
great what type of movie are you looking for?
have you seen @ insidious  (2011) @ ? or @ the possession (2012) @ ?
its a scary movie about demons google the name and enjoy the trailer
@ unbreakable  (2000) @ ?
huh?
no, nothing like @ saw  (2004) @
its about a guy who can not be hurt. kinda like a superhero. he goes after real life bad guys. the villian of the movie is the opposite....his bones are like glass.
anyways, i hope you liked my suggestions.
yes rings
it is horror movie where the little girl fears all as a ghost coming out of the well.
oh nice why don't you see the full movie

@ singin in the rain (1952) @ was a favorite of mine as was @ south pacific  (1958) @ i do remember @ fame  (1980) @ wasnt @ dirty dancing @ about the same time?
good night
off the top of my head the movie @ shrek (2001) @ comes to mind. only because alot of lines from it are stuck in my head if you dont like animated stuff i rewatched @ john wick (2014) @ recently have you seen it?
i saw @ the usual suspects (1995) @ for the first time last week, it wasn't half bad
0_0 never was a fan of action movies. didn;t think i had to watch it lol
there are probably many classics that ive never seen but ill check em out eventually. but this is not about me. whats one of your favs?
:) ok cool
awesome. hope you choose one of these to enjoy. i might check out a few of them myself
like one fart joke but it's more than just the frat boy humor and @ shrek 2 (2004) @ is awesome as well hope you like it
hello what kind of movies do you like?
do you like thrillers?
have you seen anything from this century like @ gone girl  (2014) @ and @ the girl with the dragon tattoo  (2011) @
i meant for thrillers not animation
huh thats interesting because i only heard negative things about red sparrow
yea i did. i love daniel day lewis and his movies but that was not something that i enjoyed it was a very well made movie for whats its worth
yes, it is my favorite movie by russel crowe. i like it even more than @ gladiator  (2000) @ which was awesome too
hello what kind of movies do you like?
hmm. what is the most recent movie you saw that you liked then off the top of your head
of course, that was a great movie. very entertaining you should check out @ borat (2006) @ if you like comedy movies
that makes sense. have you seen @ kick-ass  (2010) @ by any chance its not a traditional super-hero movie but its still considered one and its great
how about @ watchmen  (2009) @. zach synder might not have done well with the new dc movies but i loved that movie have you seen it/
its phenemonal especially if you see the directors cut i highly recommend that version of the moive

sorry the light bulb in my bathroom blew out so i went to change it
i am sure you have seen @ taken  (2008) @

sounds like a plan
you're welcome bye
hi. i am good, thanks for asking. what about you?
can i recommend you something? what kind of movies do you like?
i love comedies, @ the hangover (2009) @ is my favorite. have you seen it? i am not a big fan of horror movies, i can't sleep at night after. the only movie i really liked is @ the ring  (2002) @
i see. maybe you should watch @ daddys home  (2015) @ @ daddy's home  (2015) @ is a good family comedy, there is also a second part @ daddys home 2 (2017) @
as for the horror movies, i also liked @ omen  (2003) @. very scary movie) honestly i only watched @ daddys home  (2015) @. i liked it. i was planning to watch @ daddy's home 2 (2017) @ tomorrow. hopefully i wont be disappointed like you said
let me know if you enjoyed watching it next time)
hopefully, have a good day)
hello my friend. how are you today?
i am good as well, thanks. how can i help you today?
lol i see. how about @ fifty shades of grey  (2015) @ ? have you watched it? i think he might be pretty uncomfortable there is also 2 more parts @ fifty shades darker  (2017) @ and @ fifty shades freed  (2018) @
i actually liked @ fifty shades of grey  (2015) @. i watched @ fifty shades darker  (2017) @ with my husband and he was uncomfortable.
i agree with you @ fifty shades of grey  (2015) @ is defiantly not worth watching again
what about @ borat (2006) @. maybe this will work in other hands @ borat (2006) @ was making me more uncomfortable, not my husband @ fifty shades of grey  (2015) @ is basically a movie for girls. he didn't like it and he said it was dumb. lol
i saw @ how to lose a guy in 10 days (2003) @. i liked it. i haven't seen @ fatal attraction (1987) @. did you like it? is it worth watching?
google says that @ gone girl  (2014) @ might be uncomfortable to watch together. bit i don;t know why. i loved @ gone girl  (2014) @ @ gone girl  (2014) @ is exactly about the revenge! maybe you should go with this one
yes by i cant say its uncomfortable. not to me i guess) there is for sure a lot of mystery in @ gone girl  (2014) @
i hope you'll enjoy! have a good day !
me too!
have you seen @ prince of the city  (1981) @ ? its an older one, but its really great christopher walken stars in it

you should! it's excellent and,,like @ no country for old men  (2007) @, it is set in texas

hello! what kind of movie are you in the mood to see today? i can make some general recommendations if you aren't sure. i watched @ black panther (2018) @ last night for the first time. it was pretty good.
hello!
oh, nice. i bet that was good. how about @ iron man  (2008) @ ? it is one of my favorites out of the super hero genre.
of course, my all-time favorite super hero movie is @ superman  (1978) @. can't beat the original. i love christopher reeves.
if you want to see something with a comedic slant, you could find @ the meteor man  (1993) @. it was funny.
yes, it was. i saw that when it was released. i'm telling my age now.
i hope i've helped!
do you like smart comedy? if so you might like @ lars and the real girl (2007) @
@ the greatest showman (2017) @ was well regarded. i've not seen it myself

@ the wildest dream (2010) @ is pretty cool have you seen it
hey there how are you
no prob
how about @ cast away (2000) @ i'm actually watching it right now. haha
after this is over i was thinking of checking out @ black panther (2018) @ if you are into comic book movies it is great.
if those aren't up your ally @ the theory of everything  (2014) @ thats another good one
and if you like something spooky. @ insidious  (2011) @
@ thor: ragnarok (2017) @
neither do i usually, but this film has some humor to it.
the actions scenes are a majority of the movie, but it has nice graphics. do you like mythology? i would rate this movie an 8 out of 10.
@ step brothers  (2008) @ is a seriously hilarious. it is extremely funny!
will ferrell and mark walburgh really compliment each other. i laughed out loud throughout the whole movie. i don't think you will regret watching it all the way through.
yes, otherwise i would be wasting your time.
@ the other guys (2010) @ is also worth checking out. that is actually the movie with mark.
it is about two cops. will's character used to be a pimp. many good laughs to be had. i hope you check them out. @ elf  (2003) @ is good for christmas time, but it is a bit corny. the new @ jumanji  (2017) @ is way better than i thought.
jack black and the rock play the roles of the avatars in the game.
there is a new one that came out last year. it is much more funny than the original.
@ talladega nights: the ballad of ricky bobby (2006) @ was alright. @ anchorman: the legend of ron burgundy (2004) @ is another classic he is in.
i just don't like the nascar theme much.
that sounds great enjoy it with friends.

one of my faves is @ raiders of the lost ark (1981) @ harrison ford for the win!

its a classic 80s one.
or perhaps @ jurassic park  (1993) @ also a great pick if you like 90's movies.

one of my all time favorites is @ the goonies (1985) @ tell me you've seen that one.
youre welcome! its been a fun chat.

it's super scary.

also, @ the babadook (2014) @ i've never seen it, but i heard it was good.
and interesing thing about @ the shining  (1980) @ is that the actress was actually pushed too hard by the producer and ended up displaying a lot of her true feelings on set. they kept all of the footage.
i think so too.:)

hello. i see you like thrillers! what about @ a perfect getaway (2009) @ or @ orphan  (2009) @ there's less slashing in these. but i like them.
its about a little girl who gets adopted by a family of four. when she comes the familys life turns upside down.
they have to figure out who she really is. massive slasher films? perhaps you might like the old @ friday the 13th  (1980) @ movies or maybe @ children of the corn  (1984) @ that's all i can think of right now that are similar.
